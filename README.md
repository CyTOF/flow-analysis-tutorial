# July-2018-single-cell-workshop
This repository is a resources for attendees of the workshop hosted at PICI in July 2018.


## Repository content
1.	Outline of instructions (below)
2.	Datasets from Science (2015) paper         **Blood and 1 of the bone marrow files need upload via LFS**
3.	R codes

## Prior to beginning make sure download required R packages:
1. Premessa
2. Scgraph
3. Scfeatures
4. Scaffold
5. Rtsne

## Introduction

## Normalization
* Bead based normalization using premessa package
* Check normalization worked by plotting bead intensitites before and after


## Debarcoding
* Check barcoding worked by viewing summary plots of barcode yields

## Basic Gating
* Check data, clean to make sure doublets, dead cells and unwanted populations removed


## Unsupervised visualization 
The first task is to get and idea of the structure of the sampleâ€” what cells are in there? How many different populations can we identify as a first pass? What are the markers combinations that define such populations? Rather than using standard dimension-reduction methods PCA or tSNE, both of which have limitations, we will use **Force-directed graphs** to achieve this.

Like other graphical methods, **Force-directed graphs** (_cite_) offer flexibility of visulization, as each node represents one cell (or cluster of cells) and each edge represents similarity between cells which can correspond to a variety of distance metrics or functions, but for our purposes we will use cosine (_link scgraphs package_).  In this layout the edges act as springs, whose strength is proportional to the weight of the edge (i.e. the similarity between the nodes). The algorithm then proceeds as a physical simulation by pulling together nodes that are similar (i.e. are connected by strong springs), and repelling dissimilar nodes. The end result is a layout where groups of similar cells are located close on the page, exactly what we set out to do for our visualization.
