# July-2018-single-cell-workshop
This repository is a resources for attendees of the workshop hosted at PICI in July 2018.


## Repository content
1.	Outline of instructions (below)
2.	Debarcoded datafiles
3.	R codes

## Prior to beginning make sure download required R packages:
1. Premessa
2. Scgraph
3. Scfeatures
4. Scaffold
5. Rtsne

## Introduction

## Normalization
* Bead based normalization using premessa package
* Check normalization worked by plotting bead intensitites before and after


## Debarcoding
* Check barcoding worked by viewing summary plots of barcode yields

## Basic Gating


## Unsupervised visualization 
* Force-directed layout

## Supervised visualization 
* Scaffold method

## Associating cell populations with endpoint(s) of interest
* Finding  cell populations that are significantly associated with an outcome
* Statistical analysis of microarrays with Citrus(?)
